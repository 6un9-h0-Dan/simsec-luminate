  insight_title: Grantees value deep and trusting relationships with funders, grounded
    in subject area expertise.
  short_description: A strong relationship between the funder and grantee builds trust,
    enabling the grantee to take more initiative and negotiate for their needs. Partnering
    with an investment lead (IL) or program officer with subject area expertise is
    especially critical for grantees to feel like their work is understood.

  long_description: "The investment lead (IL) or program officer is the face of Luminate
    for grantees. A positive experience with an IL reflects very well on the organization
    as a whole. IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly valued.\n\nThe
    ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel understood and
    heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with GCE as a team.
    One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional, constructive,
    and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.” \n\nOrganizations
    who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly positive about their
    IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention they received. “They’ve
    truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators in our work as they
    do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey. \n\nGCE’s openness to collaboration
    and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive for those who had taken the
    initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who were confident enough to push
    back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting — felt respected and heard,
    and often got what they asked for. Having pushed back didn’t seem to hurt their
    reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything, it seemed to lead to greater
    mutual respect."

    quote: "“I don’t really understand how decisions are made.”"
  long_description: "\nWhen we asked grantees about their experiences with GCE, almost
    all of them mentioned that theirs was an exceptional or unique case, and not likely
    to be generalizable feedback. This seems to stem from a lack of structure in the
    IL/grantee relationship overall. Funding relationships fall somewhere on the spectrum
    between “hands-on” – meaning customized, high-touch interactions – and “hands-off”
    – meaning more standardized, low-touch interactions. Both extremes have advantages
    and disadvantages. Overall, this “culture of exceptions” can be associated with
    a lack of transparency, high unpredictability, and even nepotism.\n\nIn more hands-on
    relationships, organizations felt they had received bespoke engagement from GCE,
    often describing their ILs as mentors and partners. This makes them feel unique
    and valued, and allows organizations to ask for help when they need it.\n\nHowever,
    some participants told us that a hands-on approach isn’t always better. The downside
    of a personalized, high-touch experience is that grantees struggled to explain
    how GCE made decisions. When asked about the main factors in GCE’s funding decision,
    many interviewees said they could not generalize because “[their] case was an
    outlier”. \n\nOn the other hand, a hands-off relationship doesn’t necessarily
    mean that all organizations receive the same treatment. While some organizations
    praised the efficiency of a standardized funding process and stated that they
    have more trust in a standardized process, many organizations with a “low-touch”
    relationship with GCE felt that their needs were not being met. They were more
    likely to see other grantees as competitors for GCE’s attention.\n\n## The Funding
    Process\n\nMany participants said they were uncertain about what to expect before
    and during the process. For example, some interviewees expressed bewilderment
    about the role of the investment committee. This confusion translated into insecurity
    about whether they can trust their ILs with information they feel might not be
    appropriate to share with the investment committee. They wondered about how much
    information they should share with their IL, especially information that might
    make their organization look bad, and how much of that will then be shared with
    the investment committee, who they may not meet for the first time until the end
    of a long process.\n\nSome participants mentioned frustration with burdensome
    processes that lasted over a year and involved multiple people from GCE. Over
    two-thirds of non-profit interviewees bemoaned a process that was long, difficult,
    and opaque – one even called it “unprofessional.”\n\nThey reported being asked
    to submit documents on short notice, and having to repeat information, sending
    the same or very similar information to multiple people at GCE. Some participants
    mentioned that they found certain periods during the investment process particularly
    stressful, such as when they weren’t sure if they would receive a final decision
    from GCE or just a request for more documentation.\n\n## Shift in Priorities\n\nGrantees
    repeatedly mentioned that the value of their relationship with Luminate is more
    than financial. While they’re part of the Luminate portfolio or network (as grantees
    referred to it), they take advantage of the Luminate stamp of approval, enjoy
    publicity and attention through their connection with Luminate, and reap the benefits
    of a personal relationship with their IL, who is often a powerful player in their
    field.\n\nSince the personal relationship with the IL is a signature component
    of being part of the Luminate network, being transitioned out of the portfolio
    can feel like a personal betrayal. When their relationship with Luminate ends,
    some organizations that have received longer-term support from Luminate feel that
    new projects are competitors, not just for money, but also for attention. Participants
    raised these concerns based on what they know of other organizations’ experiences,
    and fears they have about the the stability of their funding.\n\nThis feeling
    of personal betrayal also goes beyond the relationship with the IL. Many grantees
    working in the space deeply identify with the issues they are working on. When
    GCE/Luminate pivots to a different investment strategy, such as focusing on new
    and emerging issues, people working in the “old” issues feel a rejection of the
    issues they personally care about. It is not only a financial, but also an emotional
    matter, to lose the support of Luminate, and one that can be seen to reflect inherent
    power imbalances in the funder-grantee relationship."
