    In June 2018, Luminate commissioned Simply Secure to conduct a human-centered design research project focused on highlighting investees’ experiences of the funding process. This is the public report from that research — the Partner Perspectives project — a collaboration between Luminate, formally the Governance and Citizen Engagement (GCE) Initiative at Omidyar Network, and Simply Secure. The interviews and survey were conducted over the course of July - September 2018.
