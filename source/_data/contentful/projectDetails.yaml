          on the experience they had while funded by Omidyar Network’s GCE initiative
          and the recommendations have been developed according to experiences with
          Omidyar Network’s processes and dynamics (rather than Luminate’s). These
          learnings can therefore be seen as a useful baseline for Luminate to evaluate
          itself against going forward.

        value: HCD research methods often take the form of semi-structured interactions,

          These techniques surface participants’ priorities and values by giving them
          control over the focus of the research. Each interaction is a unique response
          to each participant, tailored to their individual concerns. HCD methods
          aren’t entirely open-ended; a common overall structure allows researchers
          to draw out parallel themes and insights.

          In contrast to a top-down process which emphasizes the priorities of a funder,
          human-centered research as applied to philanthropy offers the opportunity
          to understand not just how a given grant impacts an organization, but how

          methods was employed: the core of this work was a series of semi-structured,
          in-depth, participant-led interviews. The interview guide contained open-ended
          questions and clear topics to cover, but remained flexible enough for the
          participant to direct time and attention to their—rather than Simply Secure’s—priorities.
          New questions that took shape during the interviews were then used to shape
          a survey. The survey contained more targeted questions, and was distributed
          to a larger group, in order to understand how these emerging questions and
          opportunity areas resonated with a broader audience. '

          lens is ideal for this type of research as it allows for better understanding
          of the participants’ context and environment, as well as the specific process
          or practice that is the focus of the research.

          Organizations who felt their relationship was particularly strong or particularly

          feedback was not needed (in the case of a strong relationship) or wouldn’t
          be heard (in the case of a bad relationship). To mitigate this, organizations
          were invited to participate multiple times, by both Simply Secure and GCE,
          and the outreach communications covered concerns around confidentiality
          and privacy."

            value: Simply Secure conducted research prior to the Luminate launch in
              October 2018, so the respondents shared their perceptions of the Governance
              & Citizen Engagement (GCE) initiative at Omidyar Network, as it was
              at that time. In this report, we have reframed current efforts around
              Luminate, and otherwise referenced “GCE” or “Omidyar,” matching participants’
              language about past experiences.
