    short_description: A strong relationship between the funder and grantee builds
      trust, enabling the grantee to take more initiative and negotiate for their
      needs. Partnering with an investment lead (IL) or program officer with subject
      area expertise is especially critical for grantees to feel like their work is
      understood.

    long_description: "The investment lead (IL) or program officer is the face of

      the organization as a whole. IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly
      valued.\n\nThe ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel
      understood and heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with
      GCE as a team. One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional,
      constructive, and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.”
      \n\nOrganizations who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly
      positive about their IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention
      they received. “They’ve truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators
      in our work as they do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey. \n\nGCE’s
      openness to collaboration and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive
      for those who had taken the initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who
      were confident enough to push back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting
      — felt respected and heard, and often got what they asked for. Having pushed
      back didn’t seem to hurt their reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything,
